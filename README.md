# SpringBootDemo
My first simple Spring Boot + MongoDB API for School management.<br />
Allows CRUD operations for Student and School, plus operations like updating year for all students or finding students in a certain school and on a certain year.<br />
Run DemoApplicationTest.java to test the implementation of School and Student Services.<br />
Run DemoApplication.java and go to: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/ to access swagger documentation and play with the API.
